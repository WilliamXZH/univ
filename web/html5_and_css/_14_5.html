			<div class="title">Music City Mafia Attacked By Monkeys</div>
			<div class="text">The Mafia boys were attacked by a rogue pack of wild Ice Monkeys tonight,and the result wasn't pretty.The 5-1 loss saw few bright moments,with one of them being a goal by Chet that was up by Duke early in the game.It was downhill then on ,as the Monkey proceeded to frustrate and aggravate the Mafia.Retribution plans are already underway!</div>
