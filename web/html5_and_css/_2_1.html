		In the beginning,Tim created the HyperText Markup Language.The Internet was without form and void,and text was upon the face of the monitor and the Hands of Tim were over the face of the keyword.And Tim said,Let there be Links;and there were links.And Tim saw that the links were good;and Tim separated the links from the text.Tim called Other Stuff.And the whole thing toghter was the first Web Page.
